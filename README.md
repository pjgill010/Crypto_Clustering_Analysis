# Crypto_Clustering_Analysis
This project utilizes unsupervised machine learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

### Summary:
- Find the Best Value for k by Using the Original Data
- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Data
- Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data
- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data
- Visualize and Compare the Results

### Questions:
- What is the best value for k? Answer: 4
- What is the total explained variance of the three principal components? Answer: 89.5%
- What is the best value for k when using the PCA data? Answer: 4
- Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data? Answer: No difference
- What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means? Answer: Having fewer features does not necessarily mean greater impact for this comparison.
